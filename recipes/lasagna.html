        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a <strong>BAD</strong> recipe for a lasagna
        that you should not follow.</p> 
        <p>This is not how you make a lasagna and as an <em>Italian</em>
        I'm deeply offended by this ignorant american recreation.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 package of lasagna</li>
            <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 jar of tomato sauce</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
                Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente;
                drain.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
                In a large skillet over medium-high heat, brown beef 
                and season with salt and pepper; drain. Stir in spaghetti
                sauce and garlic and simmer 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>
                In a medium bowl, combine mozzarella, Cheddar and ricotta;
                stir well. In 9x13 inch pan, alternate layers of noodles, 
                meat mixture and cheese mixture until pan is filled.
            </li>
        </ol>
